      Digital Resistance and the Politics of Interface explores how net artists use digital platforms to amplify voices that society has tried to silence, not because they were ever truly voiceless but because dominant systems refused to listen. These works confront audiences through familiar digital interfaces like chatbots, websites, and databases, forcing us to engage with the political realities embedded in everyday technology. In Sandy Speaks, American Artist reimagines Sandra Bland not as a statistic or headline but as a speaking presence, inviting users into a direct conversation about race, justice, and police violence. Harwood and Yokokoji’s Lungs transforms Nazi-era labor data into a haunting sonic experience, using the sound of breath to give weight and presence to lives lost in concentration camps. Damali Ayo’s Rent a Negro mimics the structure of a commercial website to expose the absurdity of racial commodification and liberal performativity. These pieces do not speak for the marginalized; they create space for those voices to be acknowledged, heard, and engaged with on their own terms.

      <h2>Sandy Speaks (2017)</h2>
      <p><strong>Artist:</strong> American Artist</p>
      <p>A chatbot exhibition (just an Apple Magic Keyboard and a projector) based on the works of Sandra Bland, a 28-year-old Black woman who was wrongfully arrested, then found dead in her jail cell. Rumblings of foul play have been involved as an attack on her activism. Talking with the chatbot answers various questions about police brutality, racial justice, etc.</p>

      <h2>Lungs (2005)</h2>
      <p><strong>Artists:</strong> Graham Harwood and Matsuko Yokokoji</p>
      <p> A computer program with speakers in a Nazi-era concentration camp that uses Nazi databases of workers of the time and calculates their breathing rates, then uses the large speakers to emit the amount of air that passes through the lungs of each dying worker/child. It was created to commentate on how IBM was complicit in Nazi horrors and to visualize the atrocities.</p>

      <h2>Rent-a-Negro (2003)</h2>
      <p><strong>Artist:</strong> Damali Ayo</p>
      <p>A website that allows users to "rent an African American" to claim they have Black friends, to stay "liberal" and closer to the latest social trends, and to enjoy the boons being in the presence of Black people provides. This was created at a time when people didn't want to talk about race openly, and it was a satire on casual racism from left-leaning folk</p>
