    <h1>figured u out</h1>

    <p><strong>I admit I lost focus</strong><br>
    You got me all off track<br>
    All the signs unnoticed<br>
    Everybody told me fall back</p>

    <p>Can I let it be noted?&nbsp;Yeah, I know I move too fast<br>
    Tryna build something that last<br>
    <em>Is that too much to ask?</em></p>

    <hr>

    <p>Look what you started up, what you started now, what we got ourselves into (yeah, yeah)<br>
    But I'm smarter now, working harder now<br>
    <b>I ain't checking up on you</b></p>

    <ul>
        <li>Take a good look what you lost</li>
        <li>Just so you know what it cost</li>
        <li>Used to be someone I call</li>
        <li>Now you mean nothing at all</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You gon' see, you gon' see one day (one day)<br>
    You've been stuck in your ways, your old ways, always<br>
    Left me to figure it out<br>
    <b>I figured you out</b></p>

    <p>I'm 'bout my figures<br>
    I'm making a killing<br>
    <em>I'm thinking in bigger amounts</em></p>

    <ol>
        <li>I figured you out</li>
        <li>Know what you about</li>
        <li>Tell me lies, you're always so defensive</li>
        <li>Fill my head up with doubts</li>
    </ol>

    <p><b>I won't bail you out</b><br>
    It took time to come to my senses<br>
    Think you're clever, I know better<br>
    Took some time to figure it out</p>

    <hr>

    <p>You ain't clever, I know better<br>
    Took some time but <strong>I figured you out</strong></p>
